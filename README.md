# Hack_N_Slash_Roguelike

## Description

This was a game prototype created for a grade 10 school project with 3 peers. It is a topdown hack and slash rogue-lite themed around hunting down monsters to use as ingredients to cook and gain powerups based off the recipes chosen.

It is not complete and is still in its experimental phase without systems being properly connected and still in the form of modules.
