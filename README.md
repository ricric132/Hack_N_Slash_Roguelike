# Hack_N_Slash_Roguelike

## Description

This was a game prototype created for a grade 10 school project with 3 peers. It is a topdown hack and slash rogue-lite themed around hunting down monsters to use as ingredients to cook and gain powerups based off the recipes chosen.

It is not complete and is still in its experimental phase without systems being properly connected and still in the form of modules.

## Project Contents:
### Player Character
- A fully functioning topdown character controller with attack combos and animations
- Takes damage with camera recoil
- Visual and sound effects for walking and attacking

### Enemies: 

A ranged enemy modelled after a green pea
- Shoots bursts of peas when the player is far, and switchs to a cone-spread blast when player is near

A melee enemy moddeled after a cabbage 
- Charges up and rolls at the player in a straight line, like a charge

Boss enemy modelled after a chicken/pheonix 
Powered/Flying Phase
- Flys across the combat area
- Summons flaming tornados that drift around the combat area
- Does bombing runs breathing fire in a straight path
Tired/Walking phase
- Combo spining slash attack
- Tail whip attack
- Leap at the player

System frameworks for resource collection and abilities/perks:
- Keeps track of player inventory and loot from mob drops
- Open cooking menu with cookbook UI to cook meals from ingredients found
- 1 ability added that summons small tomatoes that jump on enemies

## Future plans

Though I do not indent on continueing this project, some features I was planning to add were:
- More enemies and recipes that gave abilities that were similiar to the mobs that were the source of the ingredients
- Natural wildlife ecosystem for the enemies so they could wonder around and interact with eachother, simulating real life wildlife
- Hunting/tracking mechanics
- Proper menues
- Story
